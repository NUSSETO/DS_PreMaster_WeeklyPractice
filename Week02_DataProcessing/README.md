# Week 02 â€“ Structured Data and Modeling Practice

This project focuses on practicing fundamental data processing techniques using small structured datasets.

## Objectives

- Explore and compare patterns across different groups.
- Combine and clean structured datasets.
- Build simple models and evaluate their performance.
- Apply basic statistical analysis to interpret data relationships.

## Notes

- This project reflects my learning process and may not represent polished or production-ready code.
- The analysis includes basic modeling steps to support data exploration and evaluation.
