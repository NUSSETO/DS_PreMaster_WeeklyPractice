## Access to electricity (% of population)

### Brazil & Mexico
- Both had well over **90% electricity access** in early 2000.
- Reached **near 100%** coverage in the early 2010s.
- Steady and consistent growth without major fluctuations.

### Thailand
- Started around **80%** in 2000, then jumped to over **90%** in 2001.
- Spiked in 2006 to nearly **100%**, but followed by a drop in 2007.
- Stabilized at around **100%** from 2010 onwards.

### India
- Started below **60%** in 2000, with a slight drop in 2001.
- Gradual rise to around **75%** by 2010, then a sharp dip in 2011 with coverage below **70%**.
- Strong rebound in 2012 to reach **80%**, followed by rapid growth.
- Reached **90%** by 2016 and around **100%** by 2020.

## Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)

### General Notes
- All four countries remained **below 50% renewable share**, indicating continued reliance on fossil fuels (maybe including nuclear).
- **No 2020 data** is available for any country.

### India
- Started with a **high renewable share (around 45%)** in 2000.
- Gradually **declined to below 35%** by 2019.
- This may reflect a rapid increase in total energy demand, with non-renewables growing faster than renewables.
- Likely due to the need for **huge amount and cost-efficient energy** during a period of rapid development.

### Brazil
- Maintained **around 40% share** in early 2000s.
- Peaked at **nearly 50%** in 2009, followed by a drop to **around 40%** in 2014.
- Share then **recovered to around 47%** by 2019.
- The dip might correlate with the **2008 financial crisis**, potentially slowing investment in renewable infrastructure.

### Mexico
- Consistently **low renewable share (around 10 to 12%)** throughout the entire period.
- No significant upward trend observed.

### Thailand
- Started at **around 20%** in early 2000s.
- Slowly climbed to **around 25%** by 2014, then slightly declined.
- Overall trend remained relatively **flat and stable**.
