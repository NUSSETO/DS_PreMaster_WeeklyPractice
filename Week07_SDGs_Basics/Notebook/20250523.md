# Week07 Day05 - Defining Project Objectives

## Focus Of The Day
Define objective for the mini project based on what I have learnt about the dataset

---

## Possible Objectives
- Why did the share of renewable energy drop in India while the GDP per capita and electricity access were rising?
- Is there any relationship between GDP per capita and electricity access?

## What Do I Need For Each Objectives

### Why did the share of renewable energy drop in India while the GDP per capita and electricity access were rising?

**Required Data:**
- Electricity access (% of population)
- Renewable energy share in final energy consumption (%)
- GDP per capita
- Electricity from fossil fuels / renewables / nuclear (TWh)
- Optional: COâ‚‚ emissions

**Planned Analysis:**
- Plot electricity access vs. renewable share over time
- Examine whether fossil fuel electricity increased faster than renewables
- Compare with GDP per capita growth
- Identify key years where divergence occurs

### Is there any relationship between GDP per capita and electricity access?

**Required Data:**
- GDP per capita
- Electricity access

**Planned Analysis:**
- Scatter plot of GDP vs electricity access
- Time series alignment of both indicators
- Optional: Linear regression or correlation

## Final Decision
I am more interested in India, so I choose the first one.
