## Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person)

### India
- In 2000, India’s per capita energy consumption was **only 1/5 to 1/7** of the other countries.
- It **steadily increased** over two decades, reaching nearly **3 times** its 2000 level by 2019, but still remains well below others.
- Slight drop in 2020, likely due to COVID-19, but less severe than in other countries.

### Thailand, Brazil, Mexico
- **Thailand** started lowest in 2000 but rapidly grew:
  - Surpassed Brazil in **2002**
  - Surpassed Mexico in **2014**
  - Sharp drop in **2020**, likely because the pandemic, but still retains top position.

- **Brazil** saw **slow and modest growth** overall:
  - Small decline after **2014**
  - Relatively stable from **2016** onward
  - Slight dip in 2020.

- **Mexico** had the **highest starting point** in 2000:
  - Peaked around **2008**
  - Gradual decline since then.
  - In 2020, energy use **dropped below its 2000 level**, though still above Brazil.

## GDP per capita

### India
- Consistently the **lowest** GDP per capita among the four countries.
- Still, it showed the **fastest** relative growth, increasing **over 4 times** from 2000 to 2020.

### Thailand
- Third lowest in 2000, but experienced **steady and resilient growth** over 20 years.
- **Less affected by both crises** (2008 and 2020), overall increases **nearly 4 times**.

### Brazil
- Declined slightly from 2000 to 2002, then **surged rapidly** until 2011 (slightly decreased in 2008).
- Surpassed Mexico in **2009** and peaked in **2011** (over **3 times** 2000 level).
- **Sharp collapse in 2015** (about 25% drop), followed by mild recovery.
- Another drop in 2020 pushed it below Thailand, but still **1.5 times** above 2000.

### Mexico
- Steady growth until **2008**, but suffered the **largest crisis shock** (decreased about 20%).
- Recovered by **2011**, then grew moderately until **2014**.
- Declined again after 2014 but achieved the **highest** among the four by 2020.
- Overall growth: only about **15%**, the lowest among the group.

### Summary
- India and Thailand followed the **typical developing pattern** of rapid GDP growth.
- Mexico, starting with a higher base, showed **slower growth**.
- 2014–2016 was a notable dip period for Brazil and Mexico (also Thailand but less noticeable), possibly tied to regional shocks.
