# Week 09 - Supervised ML

This project explores supervised machine learning, including regression models, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

## Objectives

- Practice regression and classification with scikit-learn.
- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1.
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features.

## Notes

- This project reflects my learning process and may not represent polished or production-ready code.
