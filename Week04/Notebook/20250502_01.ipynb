    "This little report explores three indicators : CO₂ emissions per capita, GDP (constant 2015 US$), and access to electricity across eight South American countries from 2016 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to understand how these indicators vary across countries and time, investigate potential correlations, and identify patterns of growth, difference, and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "All visualizations were created using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), and the dataset was cleaned and structured manually as part of this data science mini project."

    "- **GDP (constant 2015 US$)**\n",

    "The raw dataset initially included 29 rows, containing a mix of actual indicator values and metadata. These were filtered to retain only the **24 valid rows** (8 countries × 3 indicators).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cleaning steps were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removed empty rows and metadata entries\n",
    "- Dropped redundant columns (e.g., `Country Code`, `Series Code`)\n",
    "- Extracted year values and converted them to integers\n",
    "- Standardized missing values (e.g., converted non-numeric strings to `NaN`)\n",
    "- Verified data types and consistency across columns\n",
    "- Restructured the dataset using `melt()` and `pivot_table()` to achieve a tidy format.\n",
    "- Computed **GDP growth rates (%)** from 2017 to 2020 using `pct_change()`\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this stage, the dataset was fully prepared for visualization, with clearly defined structures and preserved missing values."
