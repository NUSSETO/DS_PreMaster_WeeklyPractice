# Week 03 â€“ ML Fundamentals

This project focuses on practicing fundamental machine learning models for structured data.  

## Objectives

- Implement linear and logistic regression models for prediction and classification tasks.
- Train decision tree models and explore model complexity control.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and validation strategies.
- Compare different models to understand strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs.

## Notes

- This project reflects my learning process and may not represent polished or production-ready code.
- This project includes basic modeling steps to support data exploration and evaluation.
