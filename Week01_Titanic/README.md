# Week 01 - Titanic Mini Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis on a simplified Titanic dataset.

## Objectives

- Understand the structure and features of datasets.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Explore relationships among different variables.

## Utility Functions

- `my_utils.py`: Contains reusable functions used for data cleaning and visualization.

## Notes

- This project reflects my learning process and may not represent polished or production-ready code.
- The analysis focuses on understanding the data rather than building predictive models.
